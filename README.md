# samba-smbd-3.x---4.x-exploit

For this second repository, I would like to gain access to a vulnerable in the Metasploitable called:

"Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)" it is a netbios-ssn service and it has two open ports (139/TCP and 445/TCP). 

This vulnerability is very easy to exploit. You just need to find the right exploit module to gain access. Fortunately, I will also be showing you additional information on how to find the full-service version name of the "netbios-ssn". Why? Well because as you can see "Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X" contains an unknown value. You can still exploit it without knowing the exact full version name but knowing how to find a full version name can be useful for some other situation.

Let us begin!

Step 1: Using good old NMAP

Note: If you haven't look my very first repository, I will be using my Metasploitable machine. This means the IP address will be the Metasploitable machine itself. This can be different based on your target's IP address and situation. 

Here we will pay attention to these two highlighted open ports:
