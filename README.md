# samba-smbd-3.x---4.x-exploit

For this second repository, I would like to gain access to a vulnerable in the Metasploitable called:

"Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)" it is a netbios-ssn service and it has two open ports (139/TCP and 445/TCP). 

This vulnerable is very easy to exploit. You just need to find the right exploit module to gain access. However, I will be showing you an additional information of how to find the full service version name of the "netbios-ssn". Why? Well because as you can see "Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X" contains an unknown value. You can still exploit it without knowing the exact full version name but knowing how to find a full version name can be really userful for some other situation.

Lets begin!
